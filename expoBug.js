This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a React Native project and involves unexpected behavior or crashes during development or build processes.  The root cause is often related to misconfigurations in the project setup, incorrect dependencies, or problems with the Expo CLI itself.  A common scenario involves installing packages that conflict with Expo's managed workflow, leading to unexpected runtime errors. Another scenario could involve issues with the project's `package.json` file, containing incorrect or missing dependencies, which can manifest during the build process.
