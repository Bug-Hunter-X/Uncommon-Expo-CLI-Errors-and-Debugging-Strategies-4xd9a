# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates troubleshooting uncommon errors encountered while using the Expo CLI for React Native development.  These errors often stem from nuanced issues beyond typical dependency conflicts.  The examples highlight practical debugging techniques and solutions.

## Common Scenarios

* **Unexpected behavior during development:** The app may crash, exhibit unexpected UI behavior, or fail to integrate with certain native modules.
* **Build failures:** The Expo CLI build process may fail with obscure error messages, hindering deployment.
* **Module conflicts:** Certain package installations may unexpectedly clash with Expo's managed workflow.
* **Configuration inconsistencies:** Errors may arise from mismatched configurations within the project's settings.

## Debugging Approach

1. **Check Expo CLI version:** Ensure the latest version is installed using `npm update -g expo-cli`.
2. **Examine error messages carefully:** Pay close attention to stack traces and error messages for clues.
3. **Review project dependencies:** Ensure compatibility between all packages in `package.json` and Expo's managed workflow.
4. **Clean and rebuild the project:** Try `expo start --clear` to refresh the environment.
5. **Isolate the problematic code:** Comment out sections of code to pinpoint the source of the issue.
6. **Consult the Expo documentation:** Thoroughly review the Expo documentation for potential solutions and workarounds.
7. **Search for similar issues:** Look for similar error reports on forums and issue trackers for possible solutions.
