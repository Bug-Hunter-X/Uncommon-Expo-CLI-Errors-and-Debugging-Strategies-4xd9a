The solution depends on the specific error encountered.  However, a common strategy involves carefully reviewing the error message, checking `package.json` for inconsistencies or conflicting packages, and attempting a clean build.  If a particular package seems to be causing problems, consider temporarily removing it to see if that resolves the issue.  Also, ensure your Expo CLI version is up-to-date.  If the problem persists, consider providing more specific details of the error to community forums or the Expo support channels for assistance.
